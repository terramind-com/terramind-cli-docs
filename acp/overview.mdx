## What is ACP?

The [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) is a standardized protocol for communication between AI agents and client applications like code editors. Terramind implements ACP to provide seamless integration with editors like Zed and other development tools.

## Why Use ACP?

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Editor] <-->|ACP Protocol| B[Terramind Server]
    B <-->|AI API| C[AI Models]
    B <-->|File Access| D[Your Project]
```

1. Your editor connects to Terramind via ACP
2. You send prompts through the editor
3. Terramind processes requests with full project context
4. Results are displayed in your editor

## Quick Start

Start the ACP server:

```bash
terramind acp
```

Or in a specific directory:

```bash
terramind acp --cwd /path/to/your/project
```

## Key Features

### Session Management

ACP maintains conversation sessions:

- **Create new sessions** for different tasks
- **Load existing sessions** to continue conversations
- **Preserve context** across requests
- **Working directory** awareness per session

### File Operations

Terramind can interact with your project files:

- **Read files** to understand code context
- **Write files** to make changes
- **Permission requests** for safe operations
- **Respects `.gitignore`** and other ignore patterns

### Tool Execution

Execute tools within the editor context:

- **Code search** to find relevant files
- **Bash commands** for project operations
- **File manipulation** with your permission
- **LSP integration** for code intelligence

## Protocol Compliance

Terramind implements ACP v1 specification:

✅ **Initialization**
- Protocol version negotiation
- Capability advertisement
- Authentication support

✅ **Session Management**
- `session/new` - Create conversations
- `session/load` - Resume sessions
- Working directory context
- MCP server configuration

✅ **Prompting**
- `session/prompt` - Process messages
- Content block handling
- Response with stop reasons

✅ **Client Capabilities**
- File read/write operations
- Permission requests
- Terminal support

## Use Cases

### In-Editor AI Assistance

Get AI help without leaving your editor:

```
You: "Refactor this function to use async/await"
Terramind: [Analyzes code, suggests refactored version]
```

### Project-Wide Understanding

Terramind understands your entire project:

```
You: "Where is the user authentication logic?"
Terramind: [Searches project, finds relevant files]
```

### Code Generation

Generate code with full context:

```
You: "Create a new API endpoint for user profiles"
Terramind: [Creates file with proper imports, follows project patterns]
```

### Debugging

Debug issues with project awareness:

```
You: "This test is failing, can you fix it?"
Terramind: [Reads test file, analyzes error, suggests fix]
```

## Supported Editors

### Zed

Zed has native ACP support. See the [Integration guide](/acp/integration) for setup instructions.

### Other Editors

Any editor implementing the ACP protocol can connect to Terramind. Check your editor's documentation for ACP support.

## Architecture

Terramind's ACP implementation consists of:

- **Agent Interface** - Implements ACP protocol specification
- **Client Interface** - Handles file operations and permissions
- **Session Manager** - Tracks conversation state
- **Server Lifecycle** - Manages JSON-RPC over stdio

Learn more in the [Architecture guide](/acp/architecture).

## Security

ACP operations are safe by default:

- **Permission requests** before file modifications
- **Sandboxed execution** for bash commands
- **Configurable restrictions** for sensitive operations
- **Audit logging** of all actions

## Performance

ACP is designed for responsiveness:

- **Streaming responses** for real-time feedback
- **Efficient context loading** from project files
- **Caching** for repeated operations
- **Minimal overhead** on editor performance

## Limitations

Current limitations (future enhancements planned):

- **Streaming** - Currently returns complete responses
- **Tool visibility** - Doesn't report tool execution progress
- **Session persistence** - Limited conversation history restoration
- **Mode support** - No mode switching yet

See the [Architecture guide](/acp/architecture) for details.
