## Introduction

The Terramind CLI is a powerful command-line interface for interacting with AI models directly from your terminal. It provides an intuitive way to get AI assistance for coding tasks, generate code, debug issues, and more.

## Basic Usage

### Interactive Mode

Start an interactive session where you can have a conversation with the AI:

```bash
terramind
```

In interactive mode, you can:
- Ask questions and get immediate responses
- Have multi-turn conversations with context
- Execute commands and see results
- Switch between different AI models

### Single Command Mode

Execute a single command and exit:

```bash
terramind run "your prompt here"
```

This is useful for:
- Quick one-off tasks
- Scripting and automation
- CI/CD pipelines
- Integration with other tools

## Command Structure

All Terramind commands follow this structure:

```bash
terramind [command] [options] [arguments]
```

### Global Options

These options work with any command:

- `--model <model>` - Specify which AI model to use
- `--help` - Show help information
- `--version` - Display version information
- `--debug` - Enable debug mode for troubleshooting

## Common Workflows

### Code Generation

```bash
terramind run "Create a React component for a user profile card"
```

### Code Explanation

```bash
terramind run "Explain this code: $(cat myfile.ts)"
```

### Debugging

```bash
terramind run "Debug this error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
```

### Refactoring

```bash
terramind run "Refactor this function to use async/await instead of promises"
```

## Working with Projects

Terramind understands your project context:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Start Terramind
terramind

# Now Terramind can access and modify files in your project
```

The CLI will automatically:
- Read your project structure
- Respect `.gitignore` files
- Access file contents when needed
- Make changes to files with your permission

## Model Selection

Choose the right model for your task:

```bash
# Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 (default, best for most tasks)
terramind run "your prompt" --model claude-sonnet-4-5

# Use GPT-5 for alternative perspective
terramind run "your prompt" --model gpt-5

# Use Claude Haiku for faster responses
terramind run "your prompt" --model claude-haiku-4-5
```

<Tip>
Different models have different strengths. Claude Sonnet excels at code generation, while GPT-5 is great for reasoning tasks.
</Tip>

## Session Management

Terramind maintains conversation context across your session:

- Each interactive session remembers the conversation history
- Context is preserved until you exit
- You can reference previous messages and responses
- File changes are tracked within the session

## Output Control

Control how Terramind displays output:

```bash
# Verbose output with detailed explanations
terramind run "your prompt" --verbose

# Minimal output (just the result)
terramind run "your prompt" --quiet

# JSON output for scripting
terramind run "your prompt" --format json
```
